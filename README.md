☁️ Deployment Details
Intended AWS Setup (As per Assignment Requirements)

The original plan was to deploy the website using:

AWS S3 for static website hosting

AWS CloudFront for HTTPS and global content delivery

Planned Steps:

Create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting

Upload build files and configure bucket policy

Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket

Enable HTTPS and configure default root object

Challenge Faced

While configuring AWS S3, billing activation was required and no free-tier option was available for static website hosting at the time of deployment.

Alternative Solution

To ensure timely submission, the website was deployed using Vercel, which provides:

Free HTTPS

Fast global CDN

Simple CI/CD integration with GitHub

This decision allowed successful deployment while maintaining performance and reliability best practices.
